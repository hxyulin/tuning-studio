# tuning-studio-dwarf

ELF and DWARF inspection for C, C++ and Rust embedded firmware. This host-side
library powers Tuning Studio's symbol browser, Live Watch and Embassy task view.
It can parse a firmware image without opening a probe or starting a UI.

## Use it

For a published release:

```toml
[dependencies]
tuning-studio-dwarf = "0.1.3"
```

The Rust library name is **`studio_dwarf`**.

```rust
use studio_dwarf::ElfParser;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let elf = ElfParser::parse("firmware.elf")?;
    for symbol in elf.get_variables().into_iter().filter(|s| s.is_readable()) {
        println!("{:#x} {}", symbol.address, symbol.demangled_name);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## What it provides

- `ElfParser` and `ElfInfo`: symbols, memory sections, source locations and DWARF
  diagnostics, with C++ and Rust demangling.
- `tree`: typed nodes identified by `NodeRef` and `Step`, including structs,
  arrays, tagged enums, pointers, bitfields and bounded borrowed-string previews.
- `type_table`: shared type definitions for custom inspection tools.
- `rebuild`: compare tracked symbols after recompiling firmware.
- `tasks`, `task_stats` and `task_trace`: Embassy task layout discovery and
  decoders for the supported statistics and event-ring formats.

Keep debug information in the ELF (`debug = 2`, `strip = false` for Rust release
profiles). Parsing cannot restore optimized-away locals. Pointer resolution and
live previews need a caller-provided memory reader; the parser does not connect
to hardware. Compiler-generated async layouts may change between toolchains.
Use diagnostics and unsupported-node results rather than assuming every type
can be interpreted. Numeric plot values use `f64`; exact inspection text is
handled separately by the app layer.

## Development

From the [repository](https://github.com/hxyulin/tuning-tools):

```sh
cargo test -p tuning-studio-dwarf
STUDIO_DWARF_ELF=path/to/firmware cargo test -p tuning-studio-dwarf -- --ignored
```

See the [fixture guide](https://github.com/hxyulin/tuning-tools/blob/main/crates/studio-dwarf/tests/fixtures/README.md)
for C, C++ and Rust examples, including the runnable inspector lab.
The parser originated in `datavis-rs`; provenance is recorded in the source.
